Zygote Term

## Introduction
It's a BBS dial-up terminal program that I wrote with Borland Pascal
(MS-DOS), during a time when the docile tones of dial-up modems ruled.
It's of no use now but I will find a way to compile it in the future.
It'll be fun to understand *"What was I thinking?"* :)

To be continued for the sake of nostalgia...
