Version 9.5

þ If you are installing this version of Zygote over an older version
  please delete the following files from your previous version,

        ZYGOTE.CFG
        ZYGOTE.LST
        ZYGOTE.KBD

þ Mouse support has been included in this version. In the terminal
  window, the left button executes @GRABTEXT while the right button
  executes @STAMPTEXT. If scroll lock is on, @STAMPTEXT will increment
  the history pointer after every execution. If the mouse cursor
  is moved to the top-right corner of the screen, the program will
  fall into screen-saver mode. Moving the cursor to the top line
  of the terminal screen and pressing the left button brings up
  the help screen. Positioning the mouse cursor at the bottom of
  the terminal screen and pressing the left button sends a
  carriage return, while pressing the right button sends an escape
  character (ascii value 27).

þ Some have reported that Zygote ran into a runtime error when
  executed from a path directory. The problem has been fixed. You
  should be able to include Zygote's directory as a path directory,
  and execute the program without any problem.

þ There was a problem with hanging up the modem by sending it a hangup
  string. The problem has been fixed.

þ In the dialing menu, all entries that are toll-charge will be
  displayed in darkgray while the other entries will be displayed
  in lightgray. This should make it easier to differentiate between
  non-toll and toll calls. If you don't have Z_LOCAL.DAT installed,
  then all entries will be displayed in lightgray.

þ It has come to my attention that some redistributions of the previous
  ZYG-90.ZIP lacked the essential file ZYGOTE.OVR. If you are passing
  Zygote along to a system, please include all the files in the
  original archive. If you are unsure what each archive contains then
  read the file content.txt.

þ Due to the success of previous versions of Zygote, a new and lower
  registration fee will be in effect. Thank you for your support.

Version 8.7

þ Some BBS software even though are set to display ANSI codes have been
  known to include some VT100 codes. So if you are on a system that
  does not scroll the screen, and you are currently emulating ANSI, then
  try switching to VT100.

þ Added the @batch.lst file capability for external protocols. Zygote will
  create a file named BATCH.LST in its TEMP directory when you tag files
  with the file directory lister.

þ If your modem is in the on-line mode even though your modem is not
  connected to a remote system, you can turn it off by sending the
  command 'AT&C1' to the modem.

þ Fixed the problem with the program showing "Missing Z_AREA0.DAT"
  The Z_AREA0.DAT does not exist; it is not included with the release
  of the program.

þ The format for the .dir file has not changed for this version.

Version 8.6

þ There was another minor error in the program. The 'execute' field
  in the dialing menu needed to be initialized.

þ You can still use the zconvert.exe program to convert your v7.0 .DIR
  file for this version; the format for v8.6 obviously haven't changed.

Version 8.5

þ In this version, the format of the .DIR file has been changed, again.
  But this time, i've included a conversion program for it. The name of
  this program is zconvert. Just type "zconvert" and follow the menu.
  It should be very easy to use. So if you are using version 7.5 make
  sure you run this program before loading up Zygote. A new 'execute'
  feature has been added. So read the zygote.doc file for more
  information.

þ A few new functions have been added to this version. Read the zygote.doc
  file or the help screen to find out what is new.

þ Apparently on some computers, Zygote freezes during the creation of
  the zygote.scl file. I think i have fixed this little problem. But if
  you are one of those who had this problem and are still having this
  problem, please let me know.

þ Some cosmetic changes.

Version 7.5

þ Changes were made to the graphic interpreter modules. Hopefully, the VT100
  emulator will work correctly now.

þ Some cosmetic changes

þ Other minor fixes

Version 7.0

þ The format for the notepad has changed. If you are using an older version
  of Zygote you should get rid of the ZYGOTE.PAD file. Also now, the
  program will place all the notepad files (*.PAD) in a directory off of
  the Zygote directory. The directory will be named NOTEPAD\. The program
  will automatically create it if you don't already have it. In the last
  version, Zygote saved all the notepad entries in one file. In this version,
  each entry is contained in its own file. This should make it more flexible.
  It will, of course, be faster when reading from and writing to it.

þ The format for the dialing directory file (*.DIR) has also changed. There
  is a converter for upgrading. If you were using v6.0 then you can use
  DIRCONV.EXE to convert your old .DIR file to the new .DIR format. Zygote
  will read/write all .DIR files in a directory name PHONE\. The program
  will create it if you don't already have it. After you use the converter
  remember to place the newly converted file in the PHONE\ directory.

þ If you registered v6.0 and used the host mode, you also need to get rid
  of the old user file and message file. Zygote has new formats for these
  two files also. Also now all host mode files will be placed in HOST\.
  The program will create this directory too if you don't already have it.

þ The Z_AREA?.DAT files also need to be placed in their own directory. The
  directory name for these files is AREADATA\. Again, the program will
  create the directory if you don't already have it. If you don't plan
  to use these files (because they do take up a lot of space), then
  just simply delete them. Zygote will still work either way.

þ There are many more changes, but these are probably the most important
  of the batch. I hope the changes I made are for the better. If not, hey
  write to me and tell me.

þ Make sure you read the document file (ZYGOTE.DOC). It is very important.
  There are many new things in there you should know about.

þ Type ZYGOTE to load the program. The program will decide if you need to
  enter anything. Have fun.
